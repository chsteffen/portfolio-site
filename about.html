		<h3>My Story</h3>
		<p>Eight years ago if you told me that I would be changing career paths to learn about web development, I would have told you you were nuts. My knowledge and interest in computers and web design/development never went further than shopping online. However, in recent years my curiousity peaked, and I began exploring web design. I tried to teach myself through books and online resources. But these languages can be difficult for someone with no experience, and after trying it out I became frustrated. Then after several months I grew excited about the prospect of web development and signed up for a coding bootcamp to help me gain a better understanding. I love the balance of creativity through user design and the rational organization behind creating series of directions.</p>
